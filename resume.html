    <h1>Tatyona Duke</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is pronounced like Tatiana, but with fancy spelling. I have been a book lover since I was a child. Even if I haven't finished a book I'm always adding more to my collection. I've dabbled in writing, and I always have new ideas waking me out of a deep sleep in the form of bizarre but entertaining dreams. </p>

    <p>In addition to my bookish habits, I have always been interested in programming. I was introduced to the world of programming in middle school. It was an after-school program aimed at getting girls interested in S.T.E.M. We made dry ice sodas and websites to "sell" our product in 6th grade, while in 7th grade we were tasked with creating video games.</p>

    <p>While my dry ice soda career never took off, the programming world has always stuck with me. I have done my best to align my jobs with my interests, so now more than ever I am prepared to build a career in programming.</p>
